paper "Benchmark of lasso-like penalized Cox models reveals improved performanc
with pre-filtering and large differences between cancers".

==================================
How to download the TCGA data (optional, a sample with 100 patients is provided)
==================================

Clinical and mRNA-seq datasets were obtained using the Broad GDAC FIREHOSE utility.

1. Go on the website https://gdac.broadinstitute.org
2. Choose the cancer and click on 'Browse' in the 'Data' column
3. Clinical data:
	3.a. On the 'Clinical' panel, click on 'Merge_Clinical'. A .zip file is downloaded.
	3.b. Open this .zip file and copy the file ''cancer-name'.clin.merged.txt' 
	(e.g. 'KIRC.clin.merged.txt') into the folder 'data_cancer/'cancer-name'/ (e.g. 'data_cancer/KIRC/).
4. mRNA data:
	4.a. On the 'mRNASeq' panel, click on 'mRNAseq_Preprocess'. A zip file is downloaded.
	4.b. Open this .zip file and copy the file ''cancer-name'.uncv2.mRNAseq_RSEM_all.txt' 
	(e.g. 'KIRC.uncv2.mRNAseq_RSEM_all.txt') into the folder 'data_cancer/'cancer-name'/ (e.g. 'data_cancer/KIRC/)..
4. miRNA data:
	4.a. On the 'miRSeq' panel, click on 'miRseq_Preprocess'. A zip file is downloaded.
	4.b. Open this .zip file and copy the file ''cancer-name'.miRseq_RPKM.txt' 
	(e.g. 'KIRC.miRseq_RPKM.txt') into the folder 'data_cancer/'cancer-name'/ (e.g. 'data_cancer/KIRC/)..
	
To overcome runing time and size issues, the data available in 'data_cancer/KIRC/' contain only 100 patients.
	
==================================
How to run the code 
==================================

1. Open the file 'Survival_preFiltering.Rproj' to open RStudio environment.
2. Open the 'main.R' file and follow the instruction in the script. 

As the running time is high, results will be saved all along the code in 'data_fit' into .RData files. Please check the code and remove the previous files if you want to launch the code a second time (previous data saved will be loaded otherwise). 

==================================
Running times 
==================================

The article value for the number of models to be learned is 50 (10 repetitions of 5-fold cross-validation). It can take a lot of 
times with 6 IQR thresholds (0:5) and 50 models learned (typically 10 hours), and we advice the user to first 
set K_folds = 3 (3 folds) and n_rep = 2 (2 repetitions)) for a first check.
